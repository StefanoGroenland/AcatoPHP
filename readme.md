# AcatoPHP
For my job application at Acato, I was assigned to build the following :

A web application in Laravel, where an user can register them self with : 'username', 'password' , 'email' , 'postalcode' , 'streetname'
and 'city' . the registration was succesfull the registered user has to receive an HTML e-mail. (I chose to log this for local development reasons)

To use this application simply clone the master branch. 
run composer install in the root directory
and see the rest for yourself :)
